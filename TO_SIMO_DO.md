# Actions for Simone

1.  **Run the Development Server**:
    - Execute `npm run dev` in the terminal.
    - Open the local URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) to view the promotional website.

2.  **Verify The "Real Dashboard" Demo**:
    - **Authentic Layout**: Confirm the Home Page hero section now looks **exactly** like your real app dashboard.
    - **Visual Details**: Check the Sidebar, 4 KPI cards (Net Worth, Cash, etc.), and the main Chart.
    - **Live Simulation**: Watch for live updates in the "Net Worth" value and chart, just like a real monitoring tool.
    - **3D Tilt**: The entire dashboard container should still tilt in 3D when you move your mouse.

3.  **Verify Features & Footer**:
    - Check the new **Cash Flow** and **Portfolio** demos on the Features page.
    - Confirm the **Footer** is compact and links work.

4.  **Deployment**:
    - When ready to publish, run `npm run build`.
    - Deploy the `dist` folder to your hosting provider.
